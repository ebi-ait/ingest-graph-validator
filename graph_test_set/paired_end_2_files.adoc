#### Test description

When a sequencing protocol is paired-end, test whether it has 2 or more sequencing files linked.



#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (s:sequencing_protocol)<-[:PROTOCOLS]-(p:process)<-[d]-(f:sequence_file)
WITH s, p, COUNT(d) as num_files
WHERE s.`paired_end` = true
AND NOT num_files >= 2
RETURN p, "Paired end sequencing processes should be linked to at least 2 files", labels(p)
