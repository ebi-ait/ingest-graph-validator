## Test: Sequence files link to cell suspension in single cell experiments

#### Test description

The biomaterial linked to the process linked to a sequence file must be a cell suspension in single cell experiments.

This next query provides the filenames, biomaterial IDs and nucleic acid sources linked together that break this assumption


#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (b:biomaterial)-[:INPUT_TO_PROCESSES]->(p:process)<-[:DERIVED_BY_PROCESSES]-(f:sequence_file), seq_path = (p)-[:PROTOCOLS]-(l:library_preparation_protocol)
WHERE NOT b:cell_suspension
AND l.nucleic_acid_source="single cell"
RETURN f.`file_core.file_name`, b.`biomaterial_core.biomaterial_id`, l.nucleic_acid_source

[NOTE]
===============================
* Each cypher snippet in '_violation.adoc' will be ran.
* The test passes if the cypher query returns no results.
* `True` is a pass, `False` is a fail.
* These tests can be renamed and added to as required.
