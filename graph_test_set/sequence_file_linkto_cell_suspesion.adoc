## Test: Sequence files link to cell suspension in single cell experiments

#### Test description

The biomaterial linked to the process linked to a sequence file must be a cell suspension in single cell experiments.

This next query provides the filenames, biomaterial IDs and nucleic acid sources linked together that break this assumption
